* WE NEED TO CODE

* task distribution
* a function SDL_Surface* to_sdl_image(struct image *img);
    that returns the corresponding sdl image.
    see: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_CreateRGBSurface
* a function struct image* image_get_rect(struct *img, int x, int y, int z, int t);
    that returns the img with top left corner (x,y) and botom right (z,t)
* we'll need to work on a basic paragraph recognition and then lines and then chars
* we'll need to think this function recursively and returning someting iterable like a list
  so that we can shot each paragraph of a picture and then each lines and then chars
* we'll need to think about a data sturct which'll be easy to use and can do what we want
* we'll need tests to show for the presentation (make test)
