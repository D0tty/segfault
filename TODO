* WE NEED TO CODE

* we'll need to work on a basic paragraph recognition and then lines and then chars
* we'll need to think this function recursively and returning someting iterable like a list
  so that we can shot each paragraph of a picture and then each lines and then chars
* we'll need to think about a data sturct which'll be easy to use and can do what we want
* we'll need tests to show for the presentation (make test)
